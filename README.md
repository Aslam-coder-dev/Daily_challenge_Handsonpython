# HANDS ON PYTHON

This repository contains my daily submissions for the 60 Days Code2Xplore Python Challenge.
Each challenge strengthens my logical thinking, problem-solving ability, and core Python programming skills.


| Day   | Challenge Title                 | Description                                                                                                                                  |

| Day 4 | Smart List Filter & Rebuilder   | Separates numbers and strings from mixed input, applies name authentication, and personalizes list modification using register number logic. |
| Day 5 | Smart Transport Load Balancing System | Classifies package weights into loading categories and applies a Personalized Loading Impact (PLI) rule based on name length using lists and conditional logic. |
| Day 6 | Smart Playlist Intelligence System | A Python program that analyzes song durations, validates inputs, categorizes the playlist, and provides suitable recommendations. Username-based access control with a cricket fan theme and music-lover validation before playlist analysis |
